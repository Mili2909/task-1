        <h1>Welcome to Plantaria</h1>
        <p>Plants are multicellular organisms with eukaryotic cells. A eukaryotic cell is a relatively large cell with a true nucleus and other organelles that perform specific functions. Plants, protists, fungi, and animals all have eukaryotic cells. Plant cells are distinguished by their cell walls containing cellulose, chloroplasts that perform photosynthesis, and a large central vacuole that holds water and keeps the plant turgid. Prokaryotic cells, on the other hand, are small with no true nucleus or organelles except ribosomes, which produce proteins. Bacteria and archaea have prokaryotic cells.

Many plants have vascular tissue, such as xylem and phloem, that carries water and nutrients throughout the plant. This is particularly important for plants that grow upwards; water needs to travel from the roots up the stem to the leaves. Vascular tissue is found in more “complex” plants. Plants are believed to have evolved from algae-like ancestors. Today, most modern-day algae are classified as bacteria, not plants. However, green algae, which also have cellulose in their cell walls and have chloroplasts that perform photosynthesis, are sometimes grouped with plants.</p>
